After having worked with Red in a full time position as a front-end programmer, I can say that it was a pleasure to work with him.
Not only did join the company after me, he ending up being so good that he was promoted to Team Leader and ended up being the person I asked for advice!
In my mind, he was a role-model and I learned a lot by working with him. 
He had a great understanding of a large project that had been coded by multiple developers over many months and was a instrumental in maintaining the current codebase as well as the introduction of new features.
